# Distributed Data Parallel Training
## ResNet50_DDP
This code is example for training with multiple GPUs using the ResNet50 model.
## SimCLR_DDP
This code implementation that modifies the DDP of SimCLR to support distributed training on GPUs with different way to running on other gpus model(ex. rtx4090).
